//! Fallback implementation in case no explicit `sse` or `avx` support is available.
//! In this case we use the standard versions of all functions which and no approximations.
//! We do that since this way the API doesn't change (so much) depending on the selected features.
//! However at the same time finding an alternative approximation implementation without
//! explicit SIMD support would be too much effort and therefore we use the standard functions.
//! This way we can also be sure that we achieve the promised unertainty :).
//! The Rust compiler does a good job to remove the otherhead of this implementation.
//! So in benchmarks this implementation has the same speed as the the standard functions.
