description = """
Digital signal processing based on real or complex vectors in time or frequency domain.
Vectors come with basic arithmetic, convolution, Fourier transformation and interpolation operations.
The vectors are optimized for sizes of a couple of thousand elements or more.

The same operations are provdided for matrices. For complete matrix algebra this lib
is intended to be used in combination with other matrix libs. Please refer to the documentation for
more information about this.
